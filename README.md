# Who Said It? - A Guessing Game 

## What it is and how to play:

Who said it is a game where you have to guess the chatacter from the quote. 

A random quote will be written on the screen, and you need to use the dropdown menus to guess the source and the character. Once you select your guess, click the button "Guess" and see how it went.

Green indicates that you guess correctly, and red that you guessed incorrectly. There will also be a tracker above the dropdowns. You have 4 guesses. Once you get it right or wrong the guessing button will stop working.

## Why did I make it?

I love games, and lately I've been playing a lot of games like this one, so I thought I could make my own game to practice my coding and designing skills.

## What technologies did I use?

#### Libraries and other technologies

- React
- Sass
- Axios

#### Languages

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

#### Software

- Figma
- Visual Studio Code
- Brave Browser (+ React Developer Tools)

## How to help (If you feel like it)

- I'd like to have more sources so the game would be more difficult and interesting, but I couldn't find more APIs that fit my needs. So if you know of more APIs that could be used for the game just let me know!
- Honest feedback would be greatly appreciated :)
